# Value-Predictor
This will predict the relationship between the input you entered

You have to think of a function (Eg- f(x)=x^2)
You have to initially enter the number of cases you want the program to study (Eg- 5)
then you will have to enter inputs and their corresponding Outputs

Eg.
Enter Input1: 5
Enter output!: 25

and so on

then, after you have entered 5 input output pairs, the program will ask for another input (Eg. -9)
Then the Program would predict the output for 9 by considering the relationships that it already had
from the 5 input-output pairs and will fix a polynomial funtion from these
